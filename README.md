# ue4-vive-modular-pawn-cpp
A C++ modular pawn setup and interactivity library for using the [HTC Vive](https://www.htcvive.com/uk/), and it's Motion Controllers, in the Unreal Engine.

**IMPORTANT: This isn't ready for production use yet and so shouldn't really be used..**

## Overview
There are a number of different input approaches used with the HTC Vive motion controller.  This project is to provide a modular system which will allow a pawn to support these approaches, along with a set of utility functions to allow simple implementation of interactive items in the environment.

There are two parallel versions of this project, one using pure Blueprints and one using C++.  This is the C++ version, the Blueprint version is available [here](https://github.com/Molt/ue4-vive-modular-pawn-bp).
## Current Status
I'm migrating my existing work over to this repository.

## Interactivity Approaches
The different interactivity mechanisms which are to be supported by the system are:

### Controller Mesh (**Not yet implemented**)
Indicating the position and rotation of the component by the use of a static mesh component.
* Pretty much every motion controller game ever..

### Collision Volume (**Not yet implemented**)
The controller has a volume attached which triggers events on interactive object.
* Moving the controller near an object and allowing you to move it about (Dragging the drawers about in *The Lab*)
* Acting as a non-physics blocking volume (The shields in *Audioshield*)

### Gesture Recognition (**Not yet implemented**)
Moving the controller round in a preset gesture to trigger a special event.
* Writing letters in the air, and using text gesture recognition.
* Drawing 'Magical symbols' in the air to cast spells.

### Laser Gun (**Not yet implemented**)
A special implementation of *Ray* interaction which allows an easy implementation of beam weapons.
* Weapons which travel in straight lines. (Firing lasers in *Space Pirates*)

### Physics Handle (**Not yet implemented**)
Attaching physics items to the controller so that you can either carry them about.
* Moving, and throwing, props. (Many of the interactions in *Job Simulator*)
* Using both controllers together for greater control over object positioning (The VR editor part of *Unreal Engine 4*)

### Physics Mesh (**Not yet implemented**)
An attached physics-based collision volume allow you to hit physics items in the game environment.
* Hitting baseballs with a bat.
* Pushing over props. (Shoving items around in *Job Simulator*)

### Projectile Gun (**Not yet implemented**)
Firing a projectile from the controller.
* Weapons which are subject to gravity.  (Firing bows in both *Holopoint* and *The Lab*)

### Projectile Ray (**Not yet implemented**)
A modified version of *Ray* where instead of using a straight ray the interaction uses a 'drooping' line.  This can be useful for *Teleport* as it makes it easier to target areas on the ground.
* Selecting a teleport location. (Choosing targets in *Budget Cuts*)

### Ray (**Not yet implemented**)
Interacting with elements by firing a 'beam' in the direction of the controller.
* Selecting items from a menu. (The game loader in *SteamVR*, Choosing tools in *TiltBrush*)

### Spatial (**Not yet implemented**)
Using the location and rotation of the controller as raw driving features for an interaction.
* Tracing curves through space (Drawing in *TiltBrush*)


## Interactive Utilities
The following features will be written as helpful functions for implementing interactive elements.

### Damage Actor (**Not yet implemented**)
Applying damage to an item, and destroying it when it takes too much.
* Damaging opponents and targets in 'non-instakill' methods. (Weapon results in *Space Pirates*, *Brookhaven Experiment* or *Arizona Sunshine*)

### Destroy Actor (**Not yet implemented **)
Destroying an interactive target instantly.
* Destroying targets which only need one hit. (Simple test targets)
* Editor tools. (Deleting objects in the VR editor for *Unreal Engine 4*)

### Grab Actor (**Not yet implemented**)
Carrying an object round with you using the controller.
* Moving props in a physics-based manner. (Moving props in *Job Simulator*)
* Moving props in a non-physics environment. (Moving props in the VR editor for *Unreal Engine 4*)

### Key Intersection (**Not yet implemented**)
Carry a specific object to a particular place, and having it trigger a reaction automatically.
* Used for key/lock interactions. (Putting a disk in the drive in *Job Simulator*)

### Physics Drag (**Not yet implemented**)
Moving an interactive object round in the environment using physics but without fixing it to the controller.
* Dragging and rotating items in the world. (Opening draws, and rotating components in the Robot Repair portion of *The Lab*)

### Physics Forces (**Not yet implemented**)
Applying forces to objects in the world.

### Menu (**Not yet implemented**)
Using the controller to select options from a standard UI, inserted onto a mesh in the environment.
* Selecting from a fixed-place menu. (The main menu in *StartVR*)
* Selecting from a mobile menu (Choosing tools in *TiltBrush*)

### Scripted Response (**Not yet implemented**)
Allowing simple events to be fired in order to allow items to have their own custom behaviors written for them.

### Selection Indicator, Audio (**Not yet implemented**)
Indicating the currently selected objects by making them have spatialized 3d audio cues.

### Selection Indicator, Generic (**Not yet implemented**)
Methods for indicating currently selected objects, handling both selecting multiple objects with a single controller, and selecting a single object with multiple controllers.

### Selection Indicator, Ghosting (**Not yet implemented**)
Indicating the currently selected objects by making them translucent and ghostly.

### Selection Indicator, Haptic (**Not yet implemented**)
Indicating selections, deselections, and status by using the controller's haptic feedback.

### Selection Indicator, Material Parameter (**Not yet implemented**)
Indicating selections and status by using parameters in [dynamic material instances](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/Materials/MaterialInstances/).

### Selection Indicator, Outline (**Not yet implemented**)
Indicating selections by outlining them in a cel-shader like manner.

### Selection Indicator, Light (**Not yet implemented**)
Indicating selections by activating a light at the target location.

### Spawn Actor (**Not yet implemented**)
Allowing events to easy spawn new items.

### Subscriber (**Not yet implemented**)
Allows actors other than the interaction target to be notifed when an interaction occurs.

### Teleport (**Not yet implemented**)
Moving the player's pawn to the location of the interaction, including basic collision/validity testing both for indication and confirmation.
* Moving the player around (Teleport methods in *The Lab*)
 
### Trigger (**Not yet implemented**)
Events triggered simply by moving the controller into the trigger volume.
